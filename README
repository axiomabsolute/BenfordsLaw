This is a simple python library that allows users to demonstrate Benford's Law through iterative refinement.
It was developed to target Python 2.7 and requires that Numpy and Matplotlib be installed.

Usage:

import BenfordsLaw
BenfordsLaw.BenfordsLawExample()

This will produce a series of scatter plots against a plot of the exact function.
